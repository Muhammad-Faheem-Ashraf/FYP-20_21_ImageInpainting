# FYP-20_21_ImageInpainting


For Denoising Purpose we are using BM3D library
In "Noise.py" file to denoise the image


For Super Resolution Purpose we are using simple CV2 library functions
In "superresolution.ipynb" we are enhancing the image quality


For Colorization Purpose we are using a Research Paper CHROMA-GAN
In "training-chroma.ipynb" file we are using it to train our model (New/transfer Learning)
In "Testing_chroma.ipynb" file we are using it to get colorized images from our trained model (by predicting the colors)


For Restroration Purpose we are using a Research Paper "Old Photo Restoration via Deep Latent Space Translation"
In "imageResoration.ipynb" file we implement the functionalities of image restoration, denoising and super-resolution


In "Cloud_Linkage_Iteration_4.ipynb" we are deploying our Denoiseing Module on Azure cloud

For front end Purpose we used Flutter
In "quicover.zip" all the files required for flutter app are present
